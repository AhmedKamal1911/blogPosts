# Understanding SSG and SSR in Next.js

Next.js provides two powerful pre-rendering options: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Each approach suits different needs and use cases in web development, allowing for both static and dynamic content generation.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** builds pages once at build time and serves the pre-built pages for each request. SSG is beneficial for:

- **Performance**: Pre-built pages load faster, improving user experience and SEO.
- **Content Stability**: Suitable for content that doesn’t change frequently, such as blog posts, product descriptions, or marketing pages.
- **Scalability**: SSG allows for high scalability, as cached pages can be served directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

SSG is ideal for sites with stable content or infrequent updates, where loading speed and scalability are priorities.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** generates pages at request time. This process is more dynamic, making it useful for:

- **Up-to-date Content**: Pages are generated per request, ensuring users receive the most current data.
- **User-Specific Data**: SSR is a good fit for personalized content that changes based on the user, such as dashboards, account data, or interactive content.
- **Flexibility**: SSR allows more flexibility with data that requires frequent updating without rebuilding the entire site.

SSR is ideal for applications where real-time or personalized data is crucial for the user experience.

## Key Differences Between SSG and SSR

- **Build vs. Request**: SSG pages are built once at build time, while SSR pages are generated with each request.
- **Speed vs. Freshness**: SSG offers faster page loads for cached content, while SSR ensures up-to-date content at the expense of some loading speed.

Choosing between SSG and SSR in Next.js depends on the application’s needs for performance, data freshness, and personalization. Leveraging the right pre-rendering strategy can greatly enhance user experience and application efficiency.
